# Content of the repository

You can find the report explaining all the steps of the project, demos of the final results and the complete code. 

We designed two final models that are complementary, one markerless model and one model using arUco markers. You can find the two scripts in the two following files "Code final ArUco model" and "Code final markerless model", and you can find a demo of both in the "Demos" file.
